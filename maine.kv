So let me explain the process in a few steps.\n\n1. If you were contacted by one of our correspondents, you will soon be informed of step 2.\n    However, if you weren't informed of this process prior to reading this article, then\n    contact one of our members for a recommendation. Once the council approves of his\n    or her decision, you may proceed to step 2.\n\n2. Okay, you're pretty much 'in' by now. So now, it's all up to you.\n    You can chose to be interviewed by your correspondent, or by me."
